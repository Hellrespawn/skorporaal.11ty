This site is powered by [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Alpine](https://alpinejs.dev/), and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Why

Having spent time learning about Angular, a full-fledged frontend framework, I wanted to use some of that knowledge for a personal site.

I was not looking to build a SPA however, so using a static site generator seemed like the obvious answer.

### Eleventy

One option that seemed promising was [Astro](https://astro.build/), which is a component-based static site generator, however the oft-changing API and poor error reporting made me put it aside.

I eventually settled on Eleventy, which is a quite popular, if minimal SSG. What this lacks compared to frontend-frameworks is built-in scoped styles and code, hence the following.

### Tailwind

Tailwind is a CSS framework that lets you compose styles directly in your markup. I had played around with it before and quite liked it. In this instance, it emulates scoped styles within our templates.

### Alpine

Alpine is a lightweight, reactive JavaScript framework. Like Tailwind it is applied directly into the markup and is automatically scoped into HTML elements. I was not familiar with these sort of frameworks, so I don't have a lot of grounds for comparison, but working with Alpine is quite nice.
