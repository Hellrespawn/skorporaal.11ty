    Hello! My name is Stef Korporaal. I am currently a student of Software
    Development at the [Amsterdam University of Applied
    Sciences](https://www.amsterdamuas.com)' [Faculty of Digital Media and
    Creative
    Industries](https://www.amsterdamuas.com/faculty/fdmci/faculty-of-digital-media-and-creative-industries.html),
    the fruits of which you are reading this on.
  </p>

  <p>
    My goal is not just to improve what programming skills I already have, but
    to learn what programming as part of team is like and to how to contribute
    to creating a product for someone else instead of just myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a part of that, this site will have some posts detailing aspects of my
    learning process. I can't guarantee that these are best practices, or even
    make sense outside of the specific courses I'm following, but they were
    useful to me at the time of writing.
