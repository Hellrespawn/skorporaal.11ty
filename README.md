# skorporaal.11ty

This repo holds my personal site and cookbook. More information about the site, including attribution, can be found in `./src/portfolio/skorporaal.com.md`.

This repository is public for the purposes of demonstration and education. Much of it is geared specifically to my personal use case and it should no be considered a template or a starter.
